## Update 31/5/2022
In the course of the service/upgrade of my Ender 5 with Tiki Monocoque and Klipper firmware, I did the input shaping calibration using ADXL345. The Y movement graph that tells me I can safely use either MZV or EI shaping with an acceleration 3000mm/s/s (which is half of the max acceleration recommended).

On the other hand, the X movement shows a very different result. With a wide spike on the PSD from 90 -133Hz. Initially I thought some screw was not properly tightened, it turned out that the wide spike is because I used 2 screws instead of 4 to secure the 4010 fan on the side.

After securing the fan, the spike got slimer with PSD starting from 100-133Hz. It was very obvious as the buzzing noise starts around 102Hz onwards. I left me puzzled, what can cause this spike at the higher frequency? I would definitely not use the 3HUMP_EI as it is too aggressive and can cause rounded edges. I can still use MZV and keep to the 3000mm/s/s acceleration. But I wanted to know if the spike was caused by a design flaw on my side.

The first change I did was to switch from spreadCycle to stealthChop to see if there was any difference. There was a drop in PSD values, and the spike became less pronounced. This means I can use less aggressive shaper ie MZV and higher accelerations. But that does not resolve the spike at higher frequency. I would rather use spreadCycle for accuracy and cooler stepper motor.

Looking at the design of Tiki Monocoque, I asked myself, what can cause the vibrations at high frequency? The 4010 fan, NF-Zone hotend and BL touch are close to the mounting points and should not to be the problem. The fan duct and 5015 fan is light weight and firmly mounted as close to the mount points as possible. 
I narrow down to the way the Orbiter v1.5 was mounted, while the base contact and the two M3 screws secures the orbiter firmly to the main body, the position of LDO motor is away from the CG of the whole system. I removed the Orbiter, switch back to spreadCycle and re-ran the x resonance test again. The results show that my guess was right, the spike was gone.

From what I deduced, there are 2 ways I can go:
1.	Redesign the mount to have the LDO motor point to towards the mounting point, giving better CG to the system. The is the difficult way as it would require me to redesign the mount and make other compromises to the stability of the mount. The constraints is due to the design of the Orbiter v1.5 and the Creality carriage plate. 
2.	Print at a slower acceleration and speed. This is the choice I decide to go along with. With this existing design, I was able to print at a velocity of 120mm/s and 3000/s/s acceleration with no drop in quality and precision. That is 2X in velocity and 4X in acceleration compared to stock Bowden system on an Ender 5. IMO that is pretty good. Maybe others can do better, but I am satisfied with these numbers. For real printing situation, I donâ€™t go above 100mm/s as I costing formula is based on print time, and those who get me to print for them are looking at quality of finish rather than speed of prints.
