## Introduction
Welcome to Tiki Monocoque github page. 

Since the launch of Tiki 3.2 in September 2021, I had done several updates to the design to improve the overall printability and functionality. In addition, I have been working on other projects ie the Donki direct drive extruder. I have learned alot (and still learning) in terms of designing a carriage and fan mount system.  In the 2022, I set out to do several things. Learn how use Klipper (done), design and build a bare-bone printer (in progress) and do an update on the Tiki system. 

Tee original goal of the designing the Tiki was to have a better fanduct system for creality Ender 5. But as time pass, I bought an Orbiter V1.5, and decided to adapt the design for it. That is how Tiki3 came about. Initially my design of the main body takes inspiration from Hangtight (thingiverse) with the side mounted hotend fan and front mounting fanduct. To put things into persepctive, I did not recieve any help nor step files from him. I redesign it from ground up to improve printability, incoporated BL touch bracket, cable relief and a mount for the Orbiter. At that time, only thing that I used from his design was the fanduct because I my Fusion360 skills were not good enough. Subsequently, I design the my own 5015 fan duct from scratch. 

Following the path of Tiki3, Tiki Monocoque is designed to support the Orbiter V1.5. <b>STL files and documentations are free for you to download on this github page</b>. NO patreon or membership needed to get access to stl, docs or exclusive support. I will try to answer or help if I can. I may (or may not) upload the step files for the body to be adapted to other hotend, but the step files for fanduct will not be shared. If you like using the design and want to spport my work, a contribution to https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/shannonheng will be greatly apperciated. If you want to use the design for commerical/academical intend, do contact me for permission. 

## Description
Tiki Monocoque as its namesake is a one piece printed body construction with the fanduct, BL Touch, Orbiter and ADXL345 mounted to it. This approach in design improves rigidity and dimension accuracy. The fanduct is redesigned with input from previous designs. All parts are design with intergrated supports. The fanduct is designed with overhangs of under 60 degree to the horizon. 


Tiki Monocoque is designed for Creality Ender and CR machines, namely
- Ender 3/3pro/3V2
- Ender 5/5pro/5plus
- CR10 (old version)
- Ender clones with same M5 and screw positions

Hotend that has been designed for:
- Creality stock CR10 hotend (tested)
- Mellow NF-Zone CR10 (tested)
- Mellow NF-Smart 
- MicroSwiss All Metal and clones
 
A 5015 fan is required to replace the stock 4010 fan. Please see the other files for print orientation and BOM of screws and nuts required.
