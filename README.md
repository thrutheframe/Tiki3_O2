Tiki3 for Orbiter V2.0/

08 Nov 2021 - prep for Tiki3_O2

12 Nov 2021 - I have been working on updating Tiki3 for the Orbiter V2.0 for the past few days. Due to the change in design of the main housing; while it is possible to do an update to the orbiter bracket, there has to be some compromises in terms of structure strength of the mounting point on the Main_Body as the mounting holes distance increased from 16-17.5mm and 16.5-19.5mm. The push force of the Orbiter is strong and the last thing I want is for it to rip out of the mounting holes during printing. I would prefer to redesign everthing from scratch than to just update Tiki3... BUT...

Sadly, I will not be working on the redesign of Tiki3 in the near future because:
- I am working on other projects.
- I do not see myself buying the Orbiter V2.0, as my current V1.5 is working very well. 
- I will be using the extruder that I designed for my future builds.
- I hurt my back recently and cannot sit too long on the PC. So whatever time I can muck over Fusion360, I want to be updating my own design that I will be using. 

Long story short, there will be no Tiki3_O2 as of now. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
