## Introduction
Welcome to Tiki Monocoque github page. 

Since the launch of Tiki 3.2 in September 2021, I had done several updates to the design to improve the overall printability and functionality. In addition, I have been working on other projects ie the Donki direct drive extruder. I have learned alot (and still learning) in terms of designing a carriage and fan mount system.  In the 2022, I set out to do several things. Learn how use Klipper (done), design and build a bare-bone printer (in progress) and do an update on the Tiki system. 

THe original goal of the designing the Tiki was to have a better fanduct system for creality Ender 5. But as time pass, I bought an Orbiter V1.5, and decided to adapt design for it. That is how Tiki3.2 came about. Initially my design of the main body takes inspiration from Hangtight (thingiverse) with the side mounted hotend fan and front mounting fanduct. The put things into persepctive, I did not recieve any help nor step files from him. I redesign it from ground up to improve printability, incoporated BL touch bracket, cable relief and a mount for the Orbiter. At that time, only thing that I used from his design was the fanduct because I my fusion360 skills were not good enough.
